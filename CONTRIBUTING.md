# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the *big_data* repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature, improvement or bug fix.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch against the main branch. Create a separate branch for each issue allows for an easier review and merging process.

## Report Issues

If you don't feel like submitting your own fix for a problem or writing your own feature code, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/Digital-Media/big_data/issues) that describes your request in detail.
